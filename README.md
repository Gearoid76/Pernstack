This is a PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node)
this also has two files that need to be run backend and then frontend ,
server is nodemon just type that.
frontend npm run start.
this will show you a login screen
this will show http://localhost:3000/ 
you will have to add /login to see the login
or /register
This runs on developement mode at the moment. 
This was a project that I was learning from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UQBMb8ZpuE where i was learning about JWT and registeration this is 1 of 2
