This is a PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node).
This also has two files that need to be run backend and then frontend,
1)server is nodemon just type that.
2)frontend npm run start.
this will show you a login screen
this will show http://localhost:3000/
you will have to add /login to see the login
or /register
3) to stop the server(s) ctrl+c
For this you will need a postgre server running on your local host
with a table of login_page and db of nodelogin
This runs on developement mode at the moment. 
This was a project that I was learning from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UQBMb8ZpuE where i was learning about JWT and registeration this is 1 of 2
